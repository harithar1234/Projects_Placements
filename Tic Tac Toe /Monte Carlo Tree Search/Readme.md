This code is about implementing the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm for playing Tic-Tac-Toe. It uses concepts like game tree search, random simulation, and backpropagation. The code is written in Python using libraries such as numpy and tqdm. The challenges in making this code include designing the game logic, implementing the MCTS algorithm, and creating opponent agents. This code provides insights into the effectiveness of the MCTS algorithm in playing Tic-Tac-Toe against different opponents. Its specialty lies in demonstrating the power of MCTS as an AI strategy in game playing.
