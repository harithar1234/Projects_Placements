## Monte Carlo Tree Search
* This project implements the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm for playing Tic-Tac-Toe.
* The algorithm uses a tree-based search approach to intelligently explore possible moves and make informed decisions.
* It includes opponent agents that play randomly or safely, allowing for evaluation of the MCTS agent's performance against different opponents.
* The project provides insights into the winning and losing statistics of the MCTS agent against random and safe opponents. <br>
