The code is a Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented using Q-Learning, a reinforcement learning algorithm. It allows an AI agent to learn and improve its gameplay strategy. The code creates different agents with different policies for making moves. The Q-learning agent uses a Q-table to make intelligent decisions based on observed rewards and states. The code challenges include designing reward systems and determining optimal learning parameters. It has an impact on AI agent training and provides a framework for evaluating agent performance.
