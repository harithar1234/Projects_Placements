This project implements the Huffman coding algorithm for file compression and decompression. The program reads an input file, analyzes its contents, and constructs a Huffman tree based on the frequency of characters. It then assigns binary codes to each character in the tree and encodes the input file accordingly, creating a compressed output file. The program also provides functionality to decompress the compressed file, reconstructing the original input file. The project aims to reduce the file size by utilizing the variable-length encoding provided by the Huffman algorithm, resulting in efficient data compression and decompression operations.
