This project implements the Huffman coding algorithm for file compression and decompression. The program reads an input file, analyzes its contents, and constructs a Huffman tree based on the frequency of characters. It then assigns binary codes to each character in the tree and encodes the input file accordingly, creating a compressed output file. The program also provides functionality to decompress the compressed file, reconstructing the original input file. The project aims to reduce the file size by utilizing the variable-length encoding provided by the Huffman algorithm, resulting in efficient data compression and decompression operations. <br>

The project is an implementation of the Huffman coding algorithm in C++. It can be used to compress and decompress files, reducing their size while preserving their content.The project uses a priority queue and a binary tree to construct the Huffman tree based on the frequencies of characters in the input file. It then assigns unique binary codes to each character and compresses the file by replacing characters with their corresponding codes, and vice versa for decompression.
