The project implements the concept of backtracking, a technique used to solve problems by exploring all possible solutions and backtracking when an invalid solution is encountered.
In this case, backtracking is used to solve Sudoku puzzles by recursively trying different numbers in empty cells and backtracking when an invalid state is reached.
The algorithm effectively explores the solution space and finds the correct solution by systematically eliminating invalid choices.
