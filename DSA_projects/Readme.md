# DSA Projects 
used Data structures and Algorithms to implement many real world applications:<br>
* **RISC-V Disassembler** <br>
Program to convert a given RISC-V machine code to their equivalent assembly syntax. The program acts as a disassembler.<br>

* **Sorting Visualizer** <br>
This Program demonstrates various sorting algorithms (bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quicksort, and heapsort) on a randomly generated array. It visualizes the sorting process step by step .<br>

* **File Zipper** <br>
Implements Huffman coding  for file compression and decompression. It utilizes priority queues, binary trees, and variable-length prefix codes for efficient data encoding and decoding.<br>

* **Sudoku solver**<br>
Implemented backtracking algorithm to solve Sudoku puzzles .<br>
