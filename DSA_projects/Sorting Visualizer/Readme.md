This project demonstrates sorting algorithms with visualizations. It allows users to select and observe the sorting process. //

The project covers several sorting algorithms, including://
Bubble Sort: The algorithm repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order./
Selection Sort: The algorithm selects the smallest element from the unsorted portion of the array and places it in the correct position in the sorted portion./
Insertion Sort: The algorithm builds the final sorted array one element at a time, inserting each element into its proper position within the sorted portion./
Merge Sort: The algorithm divides the array into smaller subarrays, sorts them recursively, and then merges them to obtain the final sorted array./
Quick Sort: The algorithm selects a pivot element and partitions the array such that all elements smaller than the pivot are placed before it, and all elements greater than the pivot are placed after it. It then recursively sorts the subarrays./
Heap Sort: The algorithm uses a binary heap data structure to build a sorted array. It repeatedly extracts the maximum element from the heap and places it in the sorted portion of the array.//

Key features include:/

Visualization: Algorithms are visually represented using colors and highlights./
Interactive: Users choose the sorting algorithm to visualize./
Real-time Updates: Console is cleared and array is displayed after each step./
Delayed Execution: Short delay between steps for clearer observation./
Randomized Input: Initial array is populated with random values./
Color Coding: The project utilizes color highlighting to enhance the visual representation of the sorting process, aiding in better comprehension.
