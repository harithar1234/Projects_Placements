The project is a Python script that automates the generation of exam papers.<br>
It uses a question bank consisting of LaTeX-formatted questions and their corresponding parameters and values.<br>
The script randomly selects questions, substitutes the parameter values, and generates unique exam papers in PDF format.
It also generates answer keys and tracks the allocation of questions across multiple exam papers. <br>
This project saves time for educators by eliminating the manual process of creating exam papers and provides a flexible and efficient solution for generating randomized exams.
