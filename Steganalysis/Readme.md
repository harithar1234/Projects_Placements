* This is a group project of 4 members.
* We implemented J-UNIWARD Stegnography (hstego) for our Web app.
* Implemented a pre-trained model on Alaska 2 dataset for JUNIWARD steganalysis.
* We have used pickel file generated from our trained neural network to implement the steganalysis in our app.

**My Contribution:** 
*Implemented steganalysis technique using Efficientnet-b2 pretrained model and J-UNIWARD images of ALASKA dataset.
