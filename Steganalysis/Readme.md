* This is a group project of 4 members.
* We implemented J-UNIWARD Stegnography (hstego) for our Web app.
* Implemented a pre-trained model on Alaska 2 dataset for JUNIWARD steganalysis.
* We have used pickel file generated from our trained neural network to implement the steganalysis in our app.

**My Contribution:** <br>
**DeepSteg: A Deep Learning approach to steganography detection** 
* Implemented steganalysis technique using Efficientnet-b2 pretrained model fine tuned on ALASKA dataset to detect JUNIWARD-encoded messages in JPEG images.
* Got Accuracy of 0.6 for trained model as it was trained using less data( with 20% of the data ) .
