Contains the Projects done by me . Lets go to see them .

## Object Detection with Voice feedback
* implemented yolov3 algorithm and used pretrained model weights to detect multiple objects in one image .
* used the google text to speech API to generate audio fle describing the objects in the image. 
* The model identifed objects with a confdence of about 99% .
