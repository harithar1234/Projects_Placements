# Projects_Placements
Contains the Projects done by me . My name is Haritha.R . Lets go to see them .

## Question paper generator
* Implemented automated system for generating unique exam papers, optimizing efficiency and customization through question bank and parameter substitution techniques.
* Streamlined processes of question selection, paper creation, and customization, resulting in improved productivity

## DSA Projects 
used Data structures and Algorithms to implement many real world applications:<br>
* **RISC-V Disassembler** <br>
Program to convert a given RISC-V machine code to their equivalent assembly syntax. The program acts as a disassembler.<br>

* **Sorting Visualizer** <br>
This Program demonstrates various sorting algorithms (bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quicksort, and heapsort) on a randomly generated array. It visualizes the sorting process step by step .<br>

* **File Zipper** <br>
Implements Huffman coding  for file compression and decompression. It utilizes priority queues, binary trees, and variable-length prefix codes for efficient data encoding and decoding.<br>

## OS Multithreading 
* The program utilizes multithreading to parallelize the task of finding perfect numbers, improving efficiency and leveraging concurrent execution. <br>
* Challenges include thread synchronization, load balancing among threads, and optimizing scalability and performance across different hardware configurations and input sizes. <br>
