## Object Detection with Voice feedback
* implemented yolov3 algorithm and used pretrained model weights to detect multiple objects in one image .
* used the google text to speech API to generate audio file describing the objects in the image. 
* The model identified objects with a confidence of about 99% .

## Hackathons
* Achieved Score: 0.87337 of  Kaggle challenge named "Is the driver at fault?" . <br>
The machine learning model used is a Stacking Ensemble Model, combining three base models: Random Forest, LightGBM, and XGBoost. These base models' predictions are integrated using a meta-model (LightGBM) to produce the final prediction, often enhancing predictive performance. The ML model is used to assess the quality of wine (0/1). <br>
* Achieved Score: 0.99828 of  Kaggle challenge named "Digit Recognizer"  .<br>
  Built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for digit recognition, to take an image of a handwritten single digit, and determine what that digit is. <br>
