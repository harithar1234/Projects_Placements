Contains the Projects done by me . Lets go to see them .

## Object Detection with Voice feedback
* implemented yolov3 algorithm and used pretrained model weights to detect multiple objects in one image .
* used the google text to speech API to generate audio fle describing the objects in the image. 
* The model identifed objects with a confdence of about 99% .

## Chatbot
* Implemented a retrieval-based chatbot(named Haritha) .
* This Chatbot is specifically designed to mimic the chatbots of Food delivery platforms. It uses uses Natural Language Processing and Deep learning.
* The chatbot achieved an accuracy of 98% in generating appropriate responses .

## Development and Management of Database
* Designed a fexible and efcient relational database from scratch for a scientifc research paper inquiry website with the referential integrity maintained. 
* Developed informative ER diagrams, efcient relational table schema and retrieved information with complex queries. 

## DSA Projects 
used Data structures and Algorithms to implement many real world applications:<br>
* RISC-V Disassembler
* Sorting Visualizer
* File Zipper
* Sudoku solver
