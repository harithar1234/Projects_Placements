The machine learning model used is a Stacking Ensemble Model, combining three base models: Random Forest, LightGBM, and XGBoost. These base models' predictions are integrated using a meta-model (LightGBM) to produce the final prediction, often enhancing predictive performance. <br>
The ML model is used to assess whether the driver involved in the accident is at fault or not. Input data has 42 features. <br>
The model achieved about 87.337 percent accuracy
